# Accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

## Accessibility

**Accessibility** refers to designing products, services, and digital content in a way that ensures they are usable and understandable by people with a wide range of abilities and disabilities. It aims to provide equal access and inclusivity for everyone, regardless of their physical, sensory, or cognitive limitations.

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of guidelines created by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). These guidelines provide standards and recommendations to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. They include three levels of conformance:

- **Level A (Minimum)**: Addresses basic accessibility requirements, making content usable by many people with disabilities.
- **Level AA (Intermediate)**: Enhances accessibility further, benefiting a larger group of users and covering a broader range of disabilities.
- **Level AAA (Advanced)**: Provides the highest level of accessibility, ensuring the content is usable by the widest range of people with disabilities.

WCAG focuses on four key principles known as POUR:

- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presented in a way that users can perceive them, regardless of disabilities.
- **Operable**: Users should be able to interact with and navigate content using various devices, including assistive technologies.
- **Understandable**: Content and operation should be clear and easy to understand for all users, including those with cognitive disabilities.
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to work reliably with current and future technologies, including assistive technologies.

By adhering to WCAG guidelines, websites and digital content become more accessible, enabling a more inclusive online experience for everyone.
